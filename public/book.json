Set in a totalitarian society ruled by the oppressive Party led by Big Brother, the novel explores themes of surveillance, manipulation, and resistance. The protagonist, Winston Smith, rebels against the Party's control by engaging in acts of rebellion and seeking truth in a world of lies. Orwell's depiction of a dystopian future, where individuality is suppressed and truth is relative, remains eerily prescient in today's world. The book serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of authoritarianism and the importance of preserving freedom and truth.",
